## Plume

Plume is an Obsidian plugin that provides seamless support for the Shavian alphabet (Shaw script). It helps you write in Shavian while building your vocabulary through live translation and smart dictionary management.

**Note**: Plume doesn't ship with any pre-built dictionaries because Shavian is a phonemic script - your spelling will depend on your accent and pronunciation. You'll build your own personalised dictionary as you write, which reflects how *you* pronounce English words.
